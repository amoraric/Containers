# Tab Container

## Description

This is my Firefox addon that groups tabs into containers, functioning like separate window sessions. Inspired by Safari's tab management.

## Features

- **Group Tabs:** Organize your tabs into different containers.
- **Separate Sessions:** Each container acts as its own window session.
- **Easy Management:** Switch and manage your containers effortlessly.

## TODO

1. Optimize code
2. Add sync with Firefox account for different devices

## Installation

**Note:** So far, this addon can only be installed as a temporary addon. I will submit it to Mozilla Firefox when it's finished, and it will be available for permanent installation on the official [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) site.

For now, here is how you can install and use it:

1. **Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`**

2. **Select "This Firefox"**

3. **Load the Temporary Addon:**
	- Select the `manifest.json` file.

4. **Enjoy**
